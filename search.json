    "text": "Life is a journey through emotions since the first light in the morning to the darkest sunset breaking the night. It is the most powerful force and at the same time, it may block all the inner fire of an empire.\nThat is it, likewise, emotions are not at the origin of nothing, it is our most perverse misconception of everything, it is where all your suffering, procrastinating and no sense emerge at every moment of your life.\nThe origin, no doubt, for millennia is these three mental states (how we perceive the world):\nConfusion (welcome to the internet, yes, with the clarity goes the darkness). Hatred (welcome to twitter, and time to time there are some accounts where enlightenment pours wisdom). And greed (welcome to LinkedIn, money and sex always travel together).\nThis wicked and fatal misconception of reality not only destroys your life (within the swirl of negative emotions) but also pushes you to the poorest mental state of all: being a baby who wait for a bus that will never come and leave your life in an eternal stand-by.\nSo, how may an emotion do help us to solve this chaos and mess if emotions are not the origin of nothing?\nHow? Well, two clearways are open wide ahead in front of you in this ebook and you are going to skyrocket your life’s top now and forever understanding how they work and using the tool kit we are going to provide you:\nNegative emotions signs where the problem is. Cope with the non-emotion state.\nNegative emotions signs where the problem is. It is the most important clue you would ever have and the place where you should start your work. Negative emotions are nice but uncomfortable. They sign. They do the most difficult job: the first step. They work! You only have to notice them, be aware when they arise, that is simple but not always easy.\nThis ebook contains the entire tool kit. Enjoy it! Love negative emotions because they pave your way to success: to be who you really are (a fucker, carpenter, a billionaire, or the next Elon Musk).\nTransform negative emotions from enemy to ally. Do it now, and every day. As your best habit, not as a goal, but as your inner warrior who feeds you with inner peace: the place where things really happen and all start and die. The place where unlimited creativity and never imagined force are. Discover who you really are. Enjoy the journey!\nOn the contrary positive emotions confirm you are on the right way, but you already knew this, and it is irrelevant, we are not here to feel emotions, we are here to showcase. Then, the point is how to use the non-emotional state as an ally and not as an enemy.  When subtle emotions hide behind an action and confuses us. Destroy them. Do it.\n\nWhen a thought hurts, that is the signal that it is not true. - Byron Katie\n\nThis ebook will provide you with the tools and the gems of millenia packed in a very simple and concise way, straight forward to you in four chapters:\n\nPain exists, negative emotions are there, add this is not bad news, it is just the way it is. Emotions are the last reaction, when something happens: they just inform you whispering. If you hear their message, you will take action. If not, new more powerful emotions will rise until they finally get your attention.\nYou will win, no way. Here is the how. Embrace it now. Learn.\nOr die. Die in the best possible way: kill your old identity, leave her/him alone and allow the new one emerge. Keep your life alive. Or die waiting the bus: be a zombie.\nSo, action! Not tomorrow, but now!"

    "text": "In Emotions: ally or enenmy, we embark on a profound exploration of life’s journey through the lens of our emotions. From the break of dawn to the darkness that envelops the night, emotions shape our experiences, serving as both a formidable force and a potential barrier to our inner fire.\nIt is within this context that we confront the misconception that emotions are the source of our suffering, procrastination, and lack of direction. Instead, we invite a shift in perspective, recognizing that emotions are not the origin of our struggles but a misperception of reality itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEmotions: ally or enenmy serves as a catalyst for personal growth and transformation. Armed with a deep understanding of our emotions and armed with the tools provided, we embark on a journey of self-discovery, resilience, and unwavering success. Let us seize this opportunity, embracing the call to action that resounds through these pages. The time for change is not some distant prospect—it is now, within our reach, waiting for us to claim it.\n\n\nWithin these pages, we present two distinct pathways that lie before us, promising to elevate our lives and empower us indefinitely. Emotions: ally or enenmy equips us with a comprehensive toolkit, guiding us to understand the workings of our emotions and harness them effectively:\n\nOur first pathway revolves around recognizing the signs of negative emotions, acknowledging their discomfort, and embracing them as valuable indicators. By doing so, we take the crucial first step towards unraveling our core issues and initiating transformative change.\nIf not, emotions can become our own worst enemy, wreaking havoc on our mental health.\n\nHerein lies the treasure trove of wisdom, offering the entire toolkit necessary for our journey. We encourage each reader to savor the process and appreciate negative emotions as guides towards success. Embracing these emotions paves the way for the realization of our true selves, whether that means becoming an ambitious go-getter, a skilled artisan, a prosperous entrepreneur, or even the next Elon Musk. By transforming negative emotions from adversaries into allies, we cultivate a daily habit that fuels our inner warrior, providing us with inner peace—the birthplace of genuine progress and transformation.\nComplementing this perspective, we recognize the significance of positive emotions as a confirmation that we are on the right path. However, our focus transcends the mere experience of emotions; we aim to showcase our authentic selves.\nThis necessitates leveraging the non-emotional state as an ally rather than an enemy. By identifying and dismantling the subtle emotions that lurk behind our actions and cloud our judgment, we gain clarity and empower ourselves to make informed decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nDrawing inspiration from Byron Katie’s wisdom, we internalize the notion that when a thought hurts, it is a signal that it is not true. Emotions: ally or enenmy distills the tools and timeless wisdom accumulated over millennia into a concise and accessible format, presented in four illuminating chapters. Within these chapters, readers will find invaluable insights, practical guidance, and the impetus to take action."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The National Science Foundation release time ago this shocking number, an average person has about 10,000 to 60,000 thoughts per day. Of those, 80% are negative and the most, almost 100% are repetitive ones. Well, perhaps the number is inaccurate, let’s say it is 25,000, highly enough?\nThose thoughts are creating an imaginary and brutal drama in your mind. These repetitive thoughts are creating a negative pattern and but still, they are triggering an entire universe of emotions related to each thought: it would be amazing if it were not terrible.\nRemember, if you are not aware of them, they will stop whispering and start shouting. They will grow until collapse your life, health either wealth, probably both of them.\nThe list is endless: fears, trauma, insecurities, present, past and future losses, failures, broken hearts and more and more fears.\nYour lack of awareness of this process is literally feeding a living organism within your mind who is colonizing your brain, your health, your body and finally your wealth.\nWhen this happens the consequences are known. No more energy for sex, or creativity. No more ideas to create a start-up, quit your boring job or love your family. Your entire life and energy goes to this organism: the pain-body.\nIt shapes your identity so far and you will eventually die for it. Your life will hopelessly bend to this side, suddenly you will see that your external life reflects your internal mind. Your day-by-day life will mirror your mind and it will not be a surprise that all your friends share their negative thoughts and failures with you.\nThen, your conversations will turn about sad stories, bad things and dark futures. You are feeding the inner monster, no healthy diet, no more exercise, no more sex, no more right sleep, no more creative job.\nYou did it and your inner energy is not unlimited: you choose between feed your inner monster either your inner peace. Yes, I understand that inner peace concept is boring but each minute you give it to your inner gang, you take it from your life. From your peace. Literally.\n“Watch your thoughts; they become words. Watch your words; they become actions. Watch your actions; they become habit. Watch your habits; they become character.\nWatch your character; it becomes your destiny.”ç\nlao tzu\nAs Dalai Lama and Daniel Goleman say “Distinguishing between constructive (positive) and destructive (negative) emotions is right there to be observed in the moment when a destructive emotion arises-the calmness, the tranquility, the balance of the mind is immediately disrupted. Other emotions do not destroy equilibrium or the sense of well-being as soon as they arise, but in fact enhance it, therefore would be called constructive.”\nThus, when destructive emotions arise your inner energy vanish for log as it is fueling that negativity. We call destructive because they are destroying you. Positive emotions boost construction, therefore, creativity and new worlds emerge.\nSo, emotions are your most inner and deep enemy, if you do not hear them.\nAnd, sure, emotions, as a living organism (pain-body) may create struggle because this dark power feedbacks your thoughts as well and as a consequence your actions which are soaring on those previous emotions and will create new destructive emotions and thoughts, and so, new actions, and so on.\nYou see. You are in serious trouble, inside a hurting cycle.\nThis repetitive cycle, this repetitive emotions and thoughts create a solid pattern in your brain. Your are rewiring your brain to this. Creating something really physical, real and strong. You are delivering all your energy to that rewiring.\nCall it identity. Call it destiny. Call it bad luck. Call it struggle.\nThat is struggling when you, as an exemple, rise a start-up (from “The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers”). The struggle is when:\nYou wonder why you started the company in the first place and people ask you why you don’t quit and you don’t know the answer. When your employees think you are lying and you think they might be right. Besides, you don’t believe you should be CEO of your company and you are in over your head and know you can’t be replaced. When everybody thinks you are an idiot, but nobody will force you. Self-doubt becomes self-hatred. You are having a conversation with someone and you can’t hear a word they are saying because all you can hear is the struggle and furthermore, you are surrounded by people and you are all alone. You go on vacation to feel better and you feel worse and food loses its taste.\nSo, here we have set the problem, maybe you have risen a family, or perhaps a start-up or a bright endeavour: you are in the creative arts and your are writing a book or acting in an important movie. Maybe you are in science or healing someone.\nSomething pushed you in the past to this quest and now you can not anymore.\n“It is not uncommon for people to spend their whole life waiting to start living.”\nEKHART TOLLE\nBut now, there is no energy to execute things. Negative emotions are devorating it when you are not watching out.\nNo motivation. No vision. No future.\nJust repetitive days as your repetitive thoughts. And destruction and negative emotions are growing and growing and your health and wealth decreasing and flattening.\nAnd repetitive behaviour: hiding from tasks and duties. The little ones are the worst.\nHere is the fundamental problem: people think of execution of a task as the little side of the business or the boring part of jobs, something you should delegate while you focus on the perceived “bigger” issues or something more creative and relevant.\nThis idea is completely wrong. Execution is not just tactics—it is a discipline and a system. It is the most important thing. It is not a goal. It is the now.\nIt is the habit: doing. Living. Execute it. Action. Do it. Now. No excuses.\nYou just already knew. The little details of a job are as important as the big ones, like being present with your kid to play with toys.\nExecution is not only the biggest issue facing life today; it is something nobody has explained satisfactorily. And the reason is that all your energy is draining on that pain-body. And you have left nothing.\nAnd, for sure, this pattern which creates all the things that surround you, this is, friends, jobs, habits, health, wealth. It is also creating your future and recreating your past.\nIt is the way the brain works. It drives you and you feed it with your life. You are hijacking yourself.\nYou know perfectly that place, where there is no freedom and always there are no options to choose. But nobody takes you to that place except you: repetitive thoughts and emotions sculpt your body. You body reflects you. Your skin reflects you.\nEmotions signs, they help, the may be your ally or your worst enemy. So far, bad news. Now, the good news is coming: thoughts and body are key and will help you to solve this struggle. This pain."

    "text": "Nowadays we may access to millennia wisdom easily but as well we can read authors and thinkers who are creating a new set of tools and skills that will help you for sure; texts written with the modern and tech world we live in mind.\nHere comes the set of tools which will be central to solve all the questions previously spoken.\nThere are a lot of diverse tools you can use. They are not theoretical, they are 100% practical and provides you with a lot of exercises that fit with your needs.\nIn fact, it is necessary the existence of this diverse amount of tools, skills and approaches because it applies to all the connections where emotions operate and evolve.\nAs we have seen, emotions are part of a human complex system design to relate to reality (and people). Emotions are central in this system of perception (body), mind (thoughts and how thoughts are processed, as symbolism or language) and higher mind (altered states).\n“Greatness is the courage to overcome obstacles.” david hawkins\nThese tools, books, authors, methods and techniques are:\nHow to understand emotions (destructive-constructive) links with the different levels of energy: Levels Of Consciousness, by David Hawkins How our mind works in different levels of symbolism and not rationally at all: Psychomagic, by Alejandro Jodorowsky How our beliefs and thoughts generate our destructive emotions: The Work, by Byron Katie Our body and others portals as gateway and the painbody, The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle How to use our creative mind and access to high states: Altered states by Jose Silva How emotions cope with money issues, Happy money by Ken Honda How to hack out mind from modern view: MindValley and The code of the extraordinary mind by Vishen Lakhiani How to understand meditation: Meditation, by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche\nLevels of Emotions-Energy, the Hawkins scale of energies frequency\nThe inner concept with this framework is that as we walk up, that is, you grow by experience, the ladder of consciousness, you shift energy from a very basic place where there are just satisfaction and lots of pain (destructive and negative emotions) to a very higher place which is plenty of personal fulfilment and positive external impact (constructive and positive emotions).\nUndoubtedly, there is a path, a ladder, an open and plain way that facilitate you your hard-working to understand what is going on. The negative emotion in this framework is a deeper bond with a level of energy and its output. So, it is relatively easy to understand and connect emotions-energy-actions and pain.\nThis framework examines “energy” and associates numerical values to the different levels of negativity-positivity from which you operate. It is pretty obvious that with high levels of energy and positivity your actions will be powerful, consistent and very defined. Thus, to relate positive emotions to constructive action is a very natural link.\nCertainly, these levels of energy are hardly manifested as pure states in you. You may be at a state of energy, let’s say with work, that may be different than where you are at in love. Either, you may have reached a higher state of energy, with lots of positive emotions and constructive actions and at moments, temporarily, return to a lower level depending on different external conditions.\n“When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like:\n‘If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right.’\nIt made an impression on me, and since then, (…), I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself:\n‘If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?’\nAnd whenever the answer has been ‘no’ for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”\nSTEVE JOBS\nHowever, this framework is a helpful tool for understanding what drives your behaviour. And, negative emotions sign you where you are: knowing the place you are is a high value-asset, it says where to start.\nThis framework works like this, from lower levels of energy to high levels of positive and constructive emotions (from “Power and Force”):\nInaction\nShame – the level of Shame is perilously proximate to death, which may be chosen as conscious suicide or more subtly elected by failure to take steps to prolong life, as in “passive suicide.” Guilt, in a variety of expressions, such as remorse, self-recrimination, masochism, and the whole gamut of symptoms of victimhood. Apathy – This level is characterized by poverty, despair, and hopelessness. The world and the future look bleak; pathos is the theme of life. Apathy is a state of helplessness; its victims are needy and lack not only resources but also the energy to avail themselves of what resources may be available. Grief – This is the level of sadness, loss and despondency. Most humans have experienced it for periods, but those who remain at this level live life in constant regret and depression. Fear – At this level there is a lot more life energy available; fear of danger is actually healthy. Fear runs much of the world. Fear of enemies, of old age or death, of rejection, and a multitude of social fears are basic motivators in most people’s lives.\nHyperactivity:\nDesire – Desire moves us to expend great effort to achieve goals or obtain rewards. The desire for money, prestige, or power runs the lives of many of those who have risen above Fear as their limiting, predominant life motif. Desire is also the level of addiction, where in desire becomes a craving more than life itself. Anger – Anger can lead to either constructive or destructive action. As people move out of Apathy and Grief to overcome Fear as a way of life, they begin to want; Desire leads to frustration, which in turn leads to Anger. Thus, Anger can be a fulcrum by which the oppressed are eventually catapulted to Freedom. But Anger expresses itself most often as resentment and revenge and is, therefore, volatile and dangerous. Pride – People feel positive as they reach this level, in contrast to the other lower energy fields. This rise in self-esteem is a balm to all pain experienced at lower levels of consciousness. Pride looks good and knows it; it struts its stuff in the parade of life. Pride as such generally has a good reputation and is socially encouraged, yet as we see from the chart of levels of consciousness, it is sufficiently negative to remain below the critical level of Courage.\nHapiness and Productivity:\nCourage – At the level of Courage, an attainment of power occurs; therefore it is also the level of empowerment. This is the zone of exploration, accomplishment, fortitude, and determination. Neutrality – At the Neutral level, a person can say, “Well, if I don’t get this job, then I’ll get another.” This is the beginning of inner confidence; sensing one’s power, one is therefore not easily intimidated. One is not driven to prove anything. Willingness – This very positive level of energy may be seen as the gateway to the higher levels. Whereas, for instance, jobs are done adequately at the Neutral level, at the level of Willingness, work is done well and success in all endeavors is common. Acceptance – At this level of awareness, a major transformation takes place, with the understanding that one is oneself the source of and creator of the experience of one’s life.\nPeak perfomance without stress:\nReason – At this level one is capable of handling large, complex amounts of data; making rapid, correct decisions; understanding the intricacies of relationships, gradations, and fine distinctions; and expert manipulation of symbols as abstract concepts, which becomes increasingly important.\nSynchornicy and extraordinary outcomes:\nLove – Love is not intellectual and does not proceed from the mind. Love emanates from the heart. It can lift others and accomplish great feats because of its purity of motive. At this level of development, the capacity to discern essence becomes predominant; the core of an issue becomes the center of focus. As Reason is bypassed, there arises the capacity of recognition of the totality of a problem and a major expansion of context, especially regarding time and process. Joy – As Love becomes more and more unconditional, it begins to be experienced as an inner Joy. This is not the sudden joy of a pleasurable turn of events; it is a constant accompaniment to all activities. Joy arises from within each moment of existence, rather than from any external source. This is a level of healing and tapping into ones spirituality. Things happen effortlessly, by synchronicity, and the world and everything in it is seen to be an expression of love and Divinity. Peace – This level of consciousness is associated with the experience designated by such terms as transcendence, self-realization, and God-consciousness. Not uncommonly, individuals at this level remove themselves from the world, as the state of bliss that ensues precludes ordinary activity. Some become spiritual teachers; others work anonymously for the betterment of mankind. Enlightenment – This is the level of powerful inspiration. Those that operate at this level set in place attractor energy fields that influence all mankind down through the ages.\nThis framework defines five groups of destructive-constructive emotions or levels of energy-consciousness, that is, from low to high:\nInaction, Hyperactivity, Hapiness and productivity, Pak perfomance without stress Synchronicy and extraordinary outcomes.\nAs you see, it is evident how negative emotions generates inactions and how positive ones allow you to create the best outcomes. The positive and constructive emotions are your best ally. Use them. (Image from @thebigwhisper)\nPyschomagic, custom poetic acts work symbolically\nThis highly practical and creative tool shows how psychological realizations can cause real transformation when manifested by concrete and custom poetic acts designed symbolically.\nWhile living in Mexico, Alejandro Jodorowsky became familiar with the eccentric but effective cures provided by folk healers and how emotions and thoughts were interwoven with deep mental pain expressed as a disease. Your mind represents symbolically that pain produced by destructive emotions. In that point, it is blatant the power of destruction tha destructive emotions hold and how well the name “destructive emotions” is asigned.\nAs a result, it is easier for the unconscious to understand the language of dreams than that of rationality. Illness can even be seen as a physical dream that reveals unresolved emotional and psychological problems.\nPsychomagic presents the shamanic and genealogical principles to create a healing therapy that could use the powers of dreams, art, and theater to empower you to heal wounds that in some cases had traveled through generations.\nThe concrete and often surreal poetic actions are part of an elaborate strategy intended to break apart the dysfunctional persona with whom you identify to connect with a deeper self.\nThat is when real transformation can manifest and heal the painbody, heal the negative and destructive emotions that block your life and get stuck and trapped in that dark point where emotions are you worst enemy and drain all your energy into more pain.\nTherefore, there is no space for big constructive emotions, thus psychomagic may be the real key to unblock those negative emotions, understand their origin and, eventually, wipe out its power over you.\nPsychomagic takes the same elements associated with a negative emotional charge and recasts them in an action that will make them positive and enable them to pay the psychological debts hindering their lives.\n“Birds born in a cage think flying is an illness.” Alejandro Jodorowsky\nMetagenealogy is a practical guide, a very useful tool, to recognizing and overcoming the patterns of negative and profound desctructive emotions and influences of the four generations before you. It explains the way how this particular and inherited painbody comes from the past and survives to the future being an organism within your mind that shapes your world’s perception. The tool’s goal is to uncover your family’s psychological heritage, heal negative emotion patterns of behavior and illness in your family tree, and let positive emotions emerge.\nIt explains how you are the result of several sorroundings pushing you: repetition of familial patterns from the past (negative emotions and painbody), the creation of new ideas from postive emotions from inner peace and society rules and punishments constraining you executed by family.\nIt is an embodied sense of self that you inherit from at least four prior generations, constituting both a life-giving treasure and a deadly trap. You are both an heir of your lineage and a necessary variation that brings the family into new territory. Are you doomed to repeat the patterns of your parents and grandparents? Or can you harness your familial and individual talents to create your own destiny?\nThe Work if a thought hurts, question it. How? Do your Work\nThe core idea where the work rests is very simple but powerful: when you believe your thoughts you suffer, but when I do not believe them you do not suffer, and that this is true for every human being. Freedom is as simple as that. Upon this idea you can access to a very usefull tool of self-inquiry known as “The Work”.\nAll the negative and suffering generated by ideas and the related destructive emotions that goes on inside our minds is not reality. It’s just a story we torture ourselves with. The Work is a simple, completely replicable system for freeing ourselves of the thoughts and emotions that make us suffer. All war begins on paper, the war against those ideas and believes that drain your positive and constructive energy, for this reason, those ideas are the target of our war.\nA thought is harmless unless we believe it. It’s not our thoughts, but our attachment to our thoughts, that causes suffering. Attaching to a thought means believing that it’s true, without inquiring. A belief is a thought that we’ve been attaching to, often for years.\nThis tool is very easy to execute. You write down your stressful thoughts, and then ask yourself the following four questions.\nQuestion 1: Is it true? This question can change your life. Be still and ask yourself if the thought you wrote down is true.\nQuestion 2: Can you absolutely know it’s true? This is another opportunity to open your mind and to go deeper into the unknown, to find the answers that live beneath what we think we know.\nQuestion 3: How do you react—what happens—when you believe that thought? With this question, you begin to notice internal cause and effect. You can see that when you believe the thought, there is a disturbance that can range from mild discomfort to fear or panic. Make a list, and be specific.\nQuestion 4: Who would you be without the thought? Imagine yourself in the presence of that person (or in that situation), without believing the thought. How would your life be different if you could not even think the stressful thought? How would you feel? Which do you prefer—life with or without the thought? Which feels kinder, more peaceful?\nTurn the thought around The “turnaround” allows you to experience the opposite of what you believe. Once you have found one or more turnarounds to your original statement, you are invited to find at least three specific, genuine examples of how each turnaround is true in your life.\nThe power of Now, how stillness stops train of thoughts mind\nNow, this new set of tools sign directly to the present moment, that is, do not allow your mind to travel to past and future and focus the now, the present moment. If your mind vagues a creates out of the present, your negative emotions would rise without control. Even with repetition or the culture of your enviroment it may create a pattern of thoughts-emotions.\nFinally, it will avoid you to be present and having the amount of necessary energy to focus at the present moment and properly execute minor task or be creative.\nThere is such a thing as old emotional pain living inside you. It is an accumulation of painful life experience that was not fully faced and accepted in the moment it arose. It leaves behind an energy form of emotional pain. It comes together with other energy forms from other instances, and so after some years you have a painbody, an energy entity consisting of old emotion. That is the painbody.\nEckhart Tolle’s message is simple and strigthforward: living in the now is the truest path to positive emotions and fullfilment. And some several tools and portals help you to understand negative emotions. Basicly, the main idea is to stop the stream of thoughts in your mind using the different aproch of every tool, that is, a portal to silence, portals to review those destructive emotions and understand them.\nThe body, as an exemple, is an excelent portal to now: using your inner body as an anchor to the Now. The gift of full attention and the power in the simple act of noticing\nBesides defining what painbody exactly is this tool adds what painbody is concealing: your life’s purpose (next lines are adapted from “The power of Now”).\nIf you look within rather than only without, however, you discover that you have an inner and an outer purpose, and since you are a microcosmic reflection of the macrocosm, it follows that the universe too has an inner and outer purpose inseparable from yours.\nThe outer purpose of the universe is to create form and experience the interaction of forms—the play, the dream, the drama, or whatever you choose to call it.\nIts inner purpose is to awaken to its formless essence. Then comes the reconciliation of outer and inner purpose: to bring that essence—consciousness—into the world of form and thereby transform the world.\nThe ultimate purpose of that transformation goes far beyond anything the human mind can imagine or comprehend.\nTo produce constructive emotions you need to clarify your inner and outer purpose; name it a vision, a big goal. Rise a family or start a company, but the lack of purpuse leaves you alone without shield in front of a lot of negative emotions produced by the absence of direcction.\nJosé Silva silva method and alpha and altered state\nJosé Silva was an electronics repairman who developed the formerly known as Silva Mind Control. Silva did research on the brain and various brain frequencies, this tool aims to reach and sustain a state of mental functioning, called alpha state, where brainwave frequency is seven to fourteen Hz: daydreaming and the transition to sleeping are alpha states.\nWith this tool, you will gain powerful positive and constructive solid emotions and habits and overcome negative emotions and its consequences (painbody, habits). It opens to increase your level of energy, free yourself from negative beliefs and behaviours, boost your creativity even learn to practise creative dreaming and awake intuition and inspiration.\nThe alpha brain state is active at your right hemisphere. You are in this state every day several times and it crucial understand how it works:\nEvery morning when you wake up (your mind passes from the theta brain state to the alpha and then to the beta). You can use this time window to train yourself in the Silva Method and induced your mind into trance. It is very important to learn how to enter and leave this brain state. And you need to understand the alpha state boundaries.\n“The discovery that human intelligence can learn to function, with awareness, at altered levels of mind, will go down in history as the greatest discovery of mankind.\nIt is sure to change our concepts of psychology, psychiatry, mind, and the subconscious.” jose silva\nFirst, you must exercise every morning, for about fifty days, and while you count backwards you have to look, behind your closed eyelids, slightly above, that is 20 degree above the horizon. It is known that the brain produces alpha brainwaves when having your eyes at this position:\nFor ten days count backwards from 100 to 1 at a 2 seconds pace. For the next ten days count backwards from 50 to 1 at the same pace. For the following ten days count backwards from 25 to 1. For the next ten days count from 10 to 1. For the last ten days count from 5 to 1.\nSecond, you have to develop your very detailed visualization skill creating an imagery tool like a mental big black TV where you will project your visualizations. You need to practise to develop your visualization skill to focus entirely at a mental movie and try that irrelevant thoughts do not interrupt. As an example, in case you meditate before sleeping, you just confirm that you are going to have a night of restorative sleep.\nThird, this is a mental movie you are going to play on your big flat mental TV:\nThink one negative emotion o problem you can not solve. Keep it for minutes. Imagine it solves by a basic and general solution. Visualize it in detail. Recreate how it feels when the problem disappears, how it affects your family, and all the positive emotins related.\nVishen Lakhiani and MindValley know the code\nYou need to know the code, as a engineer and programmer, Vishen Lakhiani, provides you with powerful tools to understand our negative emotions and mindset and how destructive they can be in the tech world we live.\nThis map guides you how to break the code and achieve extraordinary results in life.\nFirst at all, our sorrounding culture may be a negative influence, that is, you must transcend the culturescape and question society’s bullshit rules.\nAs you move through life, you are constantly told what you should do or how you should live. Our culture contains many outdated beliefs that dictate what kind of job and education you should have and how you should think and eat. Or weather, as an exemple, you need a college degree to guarantee success. Maybe you do not need a degree at all. Maybe you are in the wrong way. Update your believe, question it.\nSecond, practice consciousness engineering and create self-encouraging models of reality. Thus, you may need to rewrite your models of reality updating your mindset, that is, redefining what you think about yourself and how this triggers negative emotions.\nThird, upgrade your system for living and be able to bend reality. This will lead you to a three-step approach of discovering, refreshing and measuring.\nSo the first step is to discover, you can do this by reading books, talking to people and exploring the world around you for inspiration. As an example, check mindvalley.com, guarantee you will find out lots of inspiration and what inspiration is. Second, refresh regularly. Third, measure how effective you are being.\nRe-coding your mindset to get the ability to bend reality. That means that you can hold onto your goals for the future while making sure that your inner peace is firmly rooted in the present by focusing on the here and now: make fun and happiness a key part of your daily life.\nFourth, practice blissipline and create a vision for their future. Blissipline starts with gratitude. It has been scientifically proven that people have more energy and experience less depression when they practice gratitude. “The people making you feel guilty for going your own way and choosing your own life are simply saying,\n‘Look at me. I’m better than you because my chains are bigger.’\nIt takes courage to break those chains and define your own life.\nSo dare to live your precious days on Earth to their fullest, true to yourself, with open heart and thoughtful mind, and with the courage to change what doesn’t work and accept the consequences.\nYou may find that you can fly farther than you ever imagined.”\nVishen Lakhiani\nReverse the froward gap. The forward gap is the distance between your present self and who you want to be. But the problem with focusing on the forward gap is that you are always keeping positive emotions out of you reach in the future and creating negative ones. Never experiencing positive ones, instead, destructive emotions that destroy your execution day-by-day.\nYou should reverse the gap and look to your past to appreciate and be grateful for what you have achieved so far. This allows you to practice blissipline.\nCrafting a vision is key for your future that corresponds with your inner peace. However, this vision can be dangerous if you confuse your vision with culturescape’s vision.\nFifth, be unfuckwithable and embrace your quest. Your motivation for reaching your vision must come from within; do not seek validation from outside.\nBe unfuckwithable. This means realizing that you depend only on yourself and that nothing anyone says or does can stop you from achieving your goals by having self-fueled goals that aren’t dependent upon others and realizing that only you have what it takes to be successful.\n“It turns out that our brains are literally hardwired to perform at their best not when they are negative or even neutral, but when they are positive.\nYet in today’s world, we ironically sacrifice happiness for success only to lower our brain’s success rates” Shawn Achor\nHappy Money powerful lessons from The Japanese Art of Making Peace with Your Money\nThere are so many emotions wrapped up in your money. Money may be stressful, but getting your finances in order may provide positive emotions instead of destructive ones. You may start to construct with a different approach to money. The practice here and useful tool is to tear apart the negative emotions which live next to money’s concept. Once done, positive emotions emerge.\nIf you are going to save money, save it while you imagine the many fun ways to spend it. Imagine it like this:\n“First class flight to Bali with lie-flat seats, with a luxurious stay at the Four Seasons Sayan. Gourmet dinner, luxury accommodations, and several spa treatments.”\n“Want to be wealthy?” Happy? Peaceful?” Say, thank you. It’s that simple.” Try being grateful for the joys in your life and watch your mood brighten. Thank those who have helped you get to wherever you are and show appreciation to those who help you in the future.  You may be surprised at how much more money and help flow your direction.  Who do you owe a thank you to?\nMeditation joy of living, unlocking the secret and science of happiness\nThe Joy of Living is a path of meditation practice that is very easily to follow by you and focus in explaining it to modern world. Meditation is a key-tool to master emotions, to understand negative and positive emotions, it empower and sharpen your real intelligence. Ultimatly, it is an esencial tool to understand your own mind.\nMeditation deals with basic functions of the mind and the movements toward inner peace and away from suffering.\nThe Joy of Living method contains three levels:\nCalming the Mind Opening the Heart Awakening Wisdom\nFirst, calming the mind, in this level you will use any situation or experience, included negative emotions and painbody, as a gateway to inner peace.\nSecond, you are meditating how to open your heart to the world around you and decrease the self-fixation that lies at the root of negative emotions.\nThird, in this level you will practise the insight meditation, a profound form of meditation that uproots the causes of negative emotions.\nThe goals of this tool included:\nHow to rest in a state of spacious and alert presence using visual objects, sounds, tastes as support to transform negative emotions and painbody. How to deal with distractions and understand daily meditation, postures, lenght and to define a session. How negative emotions relate to fixate just in your wellbeing and positive mental states can grow. How to see beyond superficial thoughts and emotions and see things as they actually are, rather the mistaken version of reality that we project onto the world."

    "text": "Emotions are bio-cultural mental states associated with the nervous system and the culture where you live. Emotions are central among with thoughts, feelings, physical and behavioural responses, and a degree of pleasure or displeasure, pain or relief.\nEmotions produce different physiological, behavioural and cognitive changes and they are a very complex process where those systems play a relevant key-role but not yet fully defined.\nEmotion is also linked to behavioural tendency. As an example, if you are an extroverted person you are more likely to be social and express your emotions, while if you are introverted one, your are more likely to be more socially withdrawn and conceal your emotions.\nTherefore, emotion is often the driving force behind lots of behaviours, positive or negative, depending on the nature of emotion.\nWhile the biological component of emotions is pretty clear, the cultural role is yet not well know but critical on some aspects:\ninner culture related to your own identity and core family beliefs as much as outer and social culture as well as cognitive bias and universal beliefs.\nThen, all these components act at the very moment of building a single emotion:\nbiology and physiology primary response the structure itself of your brain culture inner culture education and family traits, level of energy emotional background: painbody, outer (and environmental) culture cognitive bias universal beliefs country culture and language\nBiology and Physiology\nThe joining between both components, biology and culture (inner and outer), is the emotion-building where the feeling is a key-bond together with the primary response (physical response as fight, fly, freeze, faint, etc..) which feedback on both ways constantly.\nBetween the sophisticated system which is a feeling and the biological and pyhsiological primary response there is the structure itself of your brain that shapes time and space.\nTherefore, this framewrok of time and space stain the way your brain starts to elaborate thoughts and emotions,\nImmanuel Kant tells us that space and time are the pure (a priori) forms of how we collect information from the outer.\nIntuition is contrasted with the conceptualization (or categorization. before you taint thoughts with your painbody, bias, family traits or beliefs) performed by the understanding, and involves the way in which we passively receive data through the external world.\nPhysical sensation (before emotion) itself is the “matter” of intuition, but its “form” lies in us, as the way in which this data is organized. Inner culture\nIt is crucial that you may differentiate feelings from emotions to understand the cultural background which conditions the whole process. And not only feelings but also affects and moods are different from emotions: emotion emerges from a elaborate process from a primary response to an external or internal stimulus.\nA feeling is the subjective experience of emotional state once it has occurred, so every person feels in a particular way and it can not be possible to feel what other people fell. You may recreate or imagine but never feel the same emotions neither feelings.\nThe way you feel a concrete feeling rose by an emotion depends on how your mind builds it and a lot of factors from inner culture and the balance among them have a big influence:\nyour emotional education and family traits, your level of energy from where you feel, your emotional background: painbody,\nThese factors define the way you feel an emotion, even it is a constructive or destructive one you may alter it completely. This interpretation and mental recreation have the power to modify deeply the meaning and direction of your reaction and consequently the behaviour that emerges from that moment.\nThus, study conscientiously the tools provided to you in chapter Two because they are key to land emotions in the safe ground and make possible you inner peace grows steadily towards positive emotions if not destructive emotions will not a mere reaction but a context and background which helps to build new emotions with a negative approach at the very beginning:\nPyschomagic by Alejandro Jodorowsky will help you with your emotional education and family traits, David Dawkins scale will show you the level of energy from where you feel, Eckhart Tolle speaks a lot about your emotional background: painbody, and gives innumerable bits of advice to cope with it, as well as Byron Katie among others,\nEmotion is a mental state and the deep nature of it is bio-cultural. As we will see in Chapter Four, the biological and physical part have very practical tools to deal with: health, diet, exercise and so on.\nHowever, it is very difficult to differentiate inner and outer culture because both of them are feedbacking each other constantly in several ways. The outer depends much more on the interaction of people and it is very reactive at each exchange.\n“What we feel is a choice.”  Piyush Shrivastav Furthermore, outer culture is linked to the vast diversity of cultures and languages that exist on our planet and it creates a huge complexity.\nLet’s see how environment and outer culture affect the way you feel, the way emotion is built by your mind.\nAs you see, emotions are a tailor-made big-scale built by you depending on such so-called inner and outer culture factors for each circumstance, always variable and unstable. Emotions are, as we all know very volatile.\nOuter culture\nThe outer cultural elements that configure your environment are these three backgrounds:\nculture create cognitive bias,  universal beliefs, particular culture from linguistics, that is, what language you talk and how many languages you know.\nCognitive biases are the no-logical errors that arise in your line of reasoning when you make a decision. This judgment is flawed by personal beliefs highly influenced by the cultural environment. You share this bias with a lot of people of your country, continent, cultural tradition or same language speakers.\nYour brain absorbs huge quantities of information during the day. Some of this information we consciously think about.\nBut as the conscious part of the brain can only be the focus on one thing at a time, your brain is looking for shortcuts to help you make decisions and do not get stuck. These mental unconscious shortcuts often fail to produce a correct judgment, and the result is cognitive biases.\n“You’ll never cross an emotional bridge, if you keep rushing back to the other side.”  T.F. Hodge\nThe most important types of biases are overconfidence, self-serving, herd mentality, loss aversion, framing cognitive, narrative fallacy, anchoring and confirmation.\nThe cognitive biases and universal beliefs could be erased if you use the tools provided in Chapter Two by Vishen Lakhiani and Bryon Katie.\nIn any case, the list of cognitive biases and universal beliefs is almost infinite. Every minute they boost negative emotions and drain lots of energy so the work here is listing all the bias and beliefs and one-by-one with the tools provided you should learn how they operate. And doing this you has wakled the first and most dificult step. With understandig and acceptance you will annihilate the power they own over you.\nList of universal beliefs:\nI need to know what to do. I don’t know what to do. I know what is best for others. I know what is best for myself. Something terrible is going to happen. It’s possible to make a mistake. People should not lie. People should respect me. I can control how others feel about me. I feel your energy. I need more money. Life isn’t fair. Parents should love their children. Children should love their parents. I need to make a decision. I can’t do anything right. I can disappoint people. I don’t want to look foolish. There’s too much to do. There’s not enough time. I know what you need. I am worthless. It’s my job to make you happy. I need a partner to be happy.It’s my fault. I should be different. I need to be careful in life.\nAfter cognitive biases and universal beliefs, you may turn to the vocabulary and words you usually use because they create the way your ideas are and therefore how emotions are delivered.\nAs an exemple, these words are not universal and neither the emotions which they describe: boredom, nostalgia, amae, sprezzatura, nonchalance, baraka and mokita. Let’s see someone.\n“Nostalgia” was coined in 1688 by Johannes Hofer as “mal du pays”, that is “homesickness”. Symptoms were also thought to include fainting, high fever, indigestion, stomach pain, and death. Nowadays this word means somethig different and very far from it was created.\nFrom Japanese tradition, the concept of “amae” is about being in harmony with others and being able to depend on them as a child could depend on their parents. Even though a child can act ridiculous, their parents would indulge them.\n“Sprezzatura” is an Italian word defined as “a certain nonchalance, so as to conceal all art and make whatever one does or says appear to be without effort and almost without any thought about it”. It is the ability of the courtier to display “an easy facility in accomplishing difficult actions which hides the conscious effort that went into them”.\nThe word “Mokita” is a fantastic word taken from a language called Kivila. It is spoken in Papua New Guinea. The best translation you can get of Mokita is, “the truth we all know but agree not to talk about.”\n“Baraka” is an ancient Sufi word, which can be translated as “a blessing, or as the breath, or essence of life from which the evolutionary process unfolds.”\nIn France, if you describe someone as “nonchalant”, you mean that they appear not no worry or care about things and that they seem very calm.\nSumming up, you have seen a lot of components which act at the very moment of building a single emotion:\nbiology and physiology primary response the structure itself of your brain culture inner culture education and family traits, level of energy emotional background: painbody, outer and environmental culture cognitive bias universal beliefs country culture and linguistics\nSo, the outcome of your body and brain when you feel something is a mix of several factors interacting in various ways.\nThis final feeling is a representation of a situation, and a bad reading on that situation conditioned by bad readings of the past may be fatal.\nThis process of reading situations and react and record information through time form your identity.\nIdentity\nSpeaking about the process of building emotion, all the factors pointed converge in that concluding concept: identity.\nYour identity is shaped by all the living past in the form of emotions, thoughts, concepts, philosophies, logics and body scars.\nThe main obstacle to respond from inner peace and constructive emotions and not with negative and destructive ones is your attachment to your identity, whatever form is in whenever moment you evaluate.\nFollowing what has been seen so far, the reason why you are attached to your identity is an emotion.\nTo be safe.\nYour brain enjoys a big gift from evolution: the imperative and urgent drive to be safe, thanks to it you are alive.\nYour evolved brain has got inner powerful structures as the reptilian complex and the limbic or paleomammalian system that watch out constantly any form of threat. It does by notices in the form of negative emotions (subtle or strong), independently the thread is real or not.\nSo there is an inner system very useful but at the same time very dangerous for your inner peace.\nThe most important skill to understand emotions and not be killed by them is to remain in silence. That is, inner peace. Have you a lot or little. Nevermind. This is the second most difficult task.\nTo open a little space of calm and silence (even the tynest) to allow you to watch out these subtle and strong notices, it does not matter if they are real or not as log as a truck is not going to run over you. Open that space, that meditation, that insight. Even if it is the most painful moment of your life. Do it. Best at moment. If not, later. Maybe fourty year later, do not worry, they are waiting for you.\nWatching out these negative emotions as destructive ones and track them to their origin at the core of your identity and then, once there, your must do the most difficult task: change.\nKill it. By understanding how it works and how it is incardinated on your identity. It does not matter if it is at core itself or your identity or at border, if it is your family identity or your country identity, if it is your damaged identiy or your winner identity. Kill it.\nThere is no tie. Either you kill it changing and evolving your way to look the world and life or your identity will kill you turning you in a zombie, that is, a deatch person that can move its body and barely speaks.\nKill and be alive o die being alive as a zombie. There is no other output. Everyday. Ever moment. Every emotion."

    "text": "“It is the same with people as it is with riding a bike. Only when moving can one comfortably maintain one’s balance.”\nThis well-known quote from Albert Einstein reflects faithfully how your brain works: if you cease on your work to terminate negative emotions, then multiple and new forms of destructive emotions will emerge with new variations of old ones.\nThis process will reinforce old patterns and painbody (inner and outer culture) and its power over you and your identity will eventually gain the dark side that painful lives perfectly know.\nOn the contrary, more work, more constructive emotions you get, the prize undoubtedly worths it. Decision making is key in this equation and it can not set aside.\nIf you feel a huge amount of energy is draining from somewhere, stop and go deep to the roots, and then, take action.\nTaking action will come with this pack, I assure you:\nIt will very painful and blocking, it will hurt like hell: do not run away, it will take a long time from decision making to take action until it is fully solved: do not hurry up, it will very difficult and tough: do not give up. Rest some time, but do not give up.\nLife is not a picnic and you are not a girl or a boy, right? If you feel so bad, you are on the right path. Feeling bad is a fundamental part of being an adult. Choose the right tool. Work. That is all. Take action.\nIf instead, you do not feel a huge amount of energy is draining but there is some fog and discomfort around you, then, there is a solution: take action!\nWhatever it happens, the main idea is easy: if your doubt is between doing either not-doing, always choose to do.\nI will repeat and explain the idea if you are stuck, doubtful and questioning both sides of the question and it is not clear. Stop thinking. Between doing either not-doing, always choose to do. Because:\nIf it goes right, save yourself that useless thinking time, If not, you will learn, remember, fail fast, life is not a picnic.\nIf you feel that fog, somehow discomfort, some bad feelings but nothing more, your must go, take action and work, exercise, run, sing, write and whatever you do through that discomfort: do whatever you do with discomfort. I promise you that action will kill it. Therefore, to solve the problems that negative emotions carry you need:\nEnergy, you have it, you are alive. Use it to grow inner peace killing negative emotions by understanding them. Tools, read this book. Action (discipline and focus). Life is not a picnic and you are an adult. Forget Disneyland now. So, action!\nIf not you will not feel emotions, but that fake that hide real emotions, real pain and real inner peace. You will live with that mental fog which chains you to negative emotions.\nYou will live sentimentality, in full self-deception, in false comfort.\nIdentity loves to splash around in the shit thinking it is real life, but no. Remember, you are moving without pedalling and life feels good, but it means you and your bike are mountains down .. backwards. Is it necessary that I explain how it finishes?\nHow to differentiate real emotions from sentimentality? Easy, you, your identity and your life change. Once you feel it, never forge. Life is unforgettable.\nThere are several rules you may apply from science which will reinforce your quest and allow to concentrate all your energy in growing faster, stronger, smarter and richer.\nThese general rules are a straightforward way to gain more constructive emotions and make them your most powerful ally.\n“Life Is Like Riding a Bicycle. To Keep Your Balance You Must Keep Moving” albert einstein\nWith these rules, you will obtain more power, but remember, this power comes with new changes and negative emotions. You are riding the bike of your life, keep pedalling. These general rules are:\nDiet/Sugar, Sleep, Cold Shower Conversations/People, Media, University Meditation, Exercise/Sex, Sun Write it down, focus, work creativity\nIf you can not, evaluate what you are not doing and why. That is, a lack of purpose? Why? Family? Painbody? Fear? Fear of what? Write it down, read, work, change. Choose a convenient tool for each moment.\nGeneral Rules to get action (I) Diet/Sugar, Cold Shower, Sleep\nI will quote Ben Greenfield to close that topic as soon as possible: “43 Reasons That Sugar Destroys Your Health.” It is 100% that sugar kills you, kills your health and destroys all your energy. Adds lots of frog to your mind and the long list you may consult. It is no brain. Stop sugar forever, you are feeding negative emotions. And, as an example, sugar can suppress your immune system and upsets the mineral relationships in your body. And the same goes for fast food…\nAnother time fighting against comfort, cold shower: this challenge (as an example of 21 days program) will up your energy levels.\nHere’s how it works: during this 21 Day Cold Shower Challenge, tap into all the health, performance, metabolism and sexuality benefits cold thermogenesis can give you. The challenge is quite simple.\nFollow the work of Wim Hof with cold habits: it will save your life and will top your energy levels.\nGeneral Rules to get action (I) Diet/Sugar, Sleep, Cold Shower\nHere you have a lot of resources to understand how sleep works. Circadian rhythms are biological processes linked to the cycles of the day. Many bodily functions vary according to these rhythms, including the following:\nBody temperature. Pulse rate and blood pressure. Reaction time and performance. The production of melatonin, serotonin, and cortisolIntestinal activity\nLight directly affects the production of melatonin, the so-called “hormone of darkness”, which is secreted mostly by the pineal gland during the hours of darkness. Melatonin plays a crucial role in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. Melatonin, among other things, promotes sleep and affects sleep quality. It is very important to track regularity, same timetable and hours and understand how brain wave patterns work.\nGeneral Rules to get action (II) Conversations/People, Media, University\nThis chapter of general rules is very easy to understand and very difficult to follow. You must remember that your inner peace and energy are very fragile and limited. Do not waste what you do not have in abundance and is a precious treasure.\nDo not waste your time in useless conversations with people. It will take from you a lot of energy and inner peace and, instead, you will carry back new negative emotions. Bad business.\nAvoid from now all media and social network that adds negative emotions to you and work in yourself. A day has got 24h long, take profit to do, to learn and not to feed negative emotions.\nBe careful where you invest your money and time. Remember, do not permit college interposes between you and your education. Perhaps if you are looking for real education University is not the right place.\nGeneral Rules to get action (III) Meditation, Exercise/Sex, Sun\n5 days of meditation practise with the integrative body–mind training method shows significantly better attention and control, showed greater improvement in conflict scores on the Attention Network Test, lower anxiety, depression, anger, and fatigue, and higher vigour on the Profile of Mood States scale, a significant decrease in stress-related cortisol, and an increase in immunoreactivity. It is clear, make mediation part of your daily routine.\nTabata training was discovered by Japanese scientist Dr Izumi Tabata. High-intensity interval training has a high impact on both the aerobic and anaerobic systems so five to ten minutes of daily routines are enough. Each exercise in a given Tabata workout lasts only four minutes, but it’s likely to be one of the longest four minutes you’ve ever endured. The structure of the program is as follows: Work out hard for 20 seconds Rest for 10 seconds Complete 8 rounds\nAbout sex: practice it, avoid masturbation, it drains a lot of energy.\nYou need 10 to 20 minutes of sun daily. Do it. No excuses.\n“All streams flow to the sea because it is lower than they are. Humility gives it its power. If you want to govern the people, you must place yourself below them.\nIf you want to lead the PEOPLE, you must learn how to follow them.\nThe Master is above the PEOPLE, And no one feels oppressed. She goes ahead of the people, and no one feels manipulated. The whole world is grateful to her.\nBecause she competes with no one, no one can compete with HER.”\nTAO TE CHING, by Lao Tzu, Translated by Stephen Mitchell\nGeneral Rules to get action (IIII) Write it down & work creativity, focus\nWriting down your goals and dreams have such a profound impact and it is a health weekly routine you should evaluate. The explanation has to do with the way our brains work and how to process emotions and thoughts. As you may know, the corpus (the wide, flat bundle of neural fibres) that connects the two hemispheres is the conduit through which the electrical signals between the right brain, which is imaginative, and the left brain, which is logical, make contact. These electrical signals then move into the spinal column, then communicate with every fibre, cell and bone in our body. It allows us to align our frequency to a life we would love living. So, if you just think about one of your goals or dreams, you’re only using the right hemisphere of your brain, which is your imaginative center. But, if you think about something that you desire, and then write it down, you also tap into the power of your logic-based left hemisphere. And you send your consciousness and every cell of your body a signal that says, “I want this, and I mean it!”\nAvoid media and mobile, avoid distractions and train your focus. Without it, it can not possibly work and get the things done. Work in a quiet environment without interruptions."
