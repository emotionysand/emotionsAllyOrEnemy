Here comes the set of tools which will be central to solve all the questions previously spoken.

There are a lot of diverse tools you can use. <mark>They are not theoretical, they are 100% practical and provides you with a lot of exercises that fit with your needs.</mark>

In fact, it is necessary the existence of this diverse amount of tools, skills and approaches because it applies to all the connections where emotions operate and evolve.

As we have seen, ``emotions`` are part of a human complex system design to relate to reality (and people). Emotions are central in this system of perception (body and brain), mind (thoughts and how thoughts are processed, as symbolism or language) and higher mind (altered states).
