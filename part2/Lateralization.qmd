## Two hemispheres, two modes

*Ian McGilchrist*'work highlights[^1] the importance of <mark>using both hemispheres of the brain to understand the world around us.</mark>

It presents two contrasting approaches:

- **reductionism** and **analysis** (associated with the left hemisphere)
- and **seeking the bigger picture** (associated with the right hemisphere).

## Three-step approach to reality

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the world, you can follow a three-step approach.[^2]

### Step 1: Seek the Big Picture

Begin by stepping back and seeking the broader context and interconnectedness of the subject.

<mark>Engage the right hemisphere of the brain, which embraces a holistic view. This perspective allows you to grasp the larger patterns, relationships, and underlying meanings that may not be immediately apparent.</mark>

### Step 2: Focus and Analysis of the Pieces

After gaining an initial understanding of the big picture, <mark>shift your attention to the details and individual components.</mark>

Activate the left hemisphere, which excels in focused attention and analysis. Break down the subject into smaller pieces and examine them in depth. This step helps you grasp the intricate nuances and finer aspects of the topic.

### Step 3: Take Back Control to the Right Hemisphere

Once you have analyzed the pieces, it is <mark>essential to shift back to the right hemisphere to complete your understanding</mark>.

Reconnect with the holistic view and integrate the details within the broader framework. Allow yourself to perceive the intrinsic value and deeper significance of the subject.

By doing so, you can gain a more profound and meaningful comprehension of the world.

## Three-step approach to reality
By following these three step:

- **seeking** the big picture,
- **focusing** on the pieces,
- and **returning** to the holistic perspective
  
you can <mark>cultivate a balanced and comprehensive understanding of the world around you.</mark>

This approach harnesses the strengths of both hemispheres of the brain, enabling you to navigate complexity, uncover the richness of reality and gain a more profound and meaningful comprehension of the world.

## Left mode reductionism

>Our talent for division, for seeing the parts, is of staggering importance â€“ second only to our capacity to transcend it, in order to see the whole.
>
>-- Iain McGilchrist

The left hemisphere tends to focus on narrow, analytical attention, breaking things down into smaller constituents. It sees value as something you invent and separate from the world, serving a utilitarian purpose. In contrast, the right hemisphere seeks a holistic view, perceiving value as intrinsic to the cosmos and fundamental to reality itself.

:::{.callout-note}
## Using just left mode is poor
<mark>The reductionist view prevalent in the contemporary world diminishes the significance of beauty, goodness, and truth.</mark>

The consequences of this worldview are evident in our surroundings. The left hemisphere sees things as static and seeks to explain how motion arises, while the right hemisphere experiences everything as flowing and seeks to understand how stability emerges from this flow.
:::


By exclusively relying on a reductionist approach, you **limit our understanding of reality**, leading to an impoverished and **meaningless** worldview. 

So, brfeaking this balance to left mode you have prioritized mechanism over organism, forsaking nature and wisdom in favor of power.

## Regain Reality

To regain a more comprehensive understanding of reality, you should achieve closeness to three features: 

- nature,
- one another,
- and the divine.

It also highlights the right hemisphere's ability to grasp implicit meaning, such as metaphors, jokes, irony, and humor, which are not explicitly stated.

Ian McGilchirst encourages you to embrace both hemispheres of our brain to comprehend the world in a more holistic and meaningful way.

By integrating reductionism and analysis with a broader perspective, you can foster a deeper connection with reality and enhance our understanding of ourselves and the world around you.
